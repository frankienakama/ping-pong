# Ping! Pong!
## by Sara Frandsen

## Description

This is a simple web page created for my third solo project at Epicodus. It is a little game that spits back a number inputted, counting up to it, and sometimes (you'll see when!) giving you a "Ping!" or a "Pong!"

## Specifications

**Determine if the input is a number greater than zero**

* Input: 0;
* Output: false;

* Input: woof!;
* Output: false;

* Input: 1;
* Output: true;

**Can count up to the given number**

* Input: 3;
* Output: [1, 2, 3];

**Replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "Ping!"**

* Output: [1, 2, "Ping!"];

**Replaces numbers divisible by 5 with "Pong!"**

* Input: 5;
